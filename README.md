# Website.Templates
This is where I keep HTML, CSS, and javaScript projects that I have built. Some material is based on tutorials, educational courses, and code-along videos as I continue to practice my web development skills. Some projects I have created in my free time for friends, family, and fun. As I learn more, I will continue to add complexity to existing and future projects. If you have any questions about any of the projects within this repository, or you would like to collaborate on another project, feel free to reach out to me directly.

Thanks

Lane
